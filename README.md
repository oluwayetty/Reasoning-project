# ELECTIVE IN AI <Reasoning Agent>

This repository contains the presentation of the paper **Simultaneous Task Allocation and Planning Under Uncertainty** and the school work presentation of the paper alongside the references we have used for our work.

## Short Abstract
The paper has proposed novel techniques for task allocation and planning in multi-robot systems operating in uncertain environments. Task allocation is performed simultaneously with planning, which provides more detailed information about individual robot behaviour, but also exploits independence between tasks to do so efficiently. Markov decision processes was used to model robot behaviour and linear temporal logic to specify tasks and safety constraints.
